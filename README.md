## About Serpent Safari
The classic game that everybody grew up playing, it was the perfect choice to recreate the game and revisit the memorable game. Recreating the game was quite an exciting experience. This game is an timeless game and we had to perfect it to our best staisfaction. Our game "Serpent Safari" has two modes you can play. The first mode is the classic game that everybody played. The player moves teh snake using the arrow keys and eat the "Apple". This mode also has the power-up, it boosts your score and the color of the snake turns to rainbow. The power-up only lasts for five seconds. The second mode is the maze mode. It has the same concept has the classic mode, but the player has to move the snake through maze and avoid getting killed. The player can pause and resume the game, and also after the game is over player can either save their score or delete it. As the player eats more, the speed of the snake increases slowly.

## Power-up
The power-up in th game, when used double the score. The red color block is the "apple" or the food that the snake eats. The purple color shere is the power-up that the snake eats. The power-up changes its location, if not eaten in less than five seconds. When the power-up is eaten by the snake, it changes it color to ranbow.

## SQL Data
We used SQL database for keeping the score for player. After playing, the player can save their highscore. If they do not want to kep their score, the score can be deleted. Player can update their score for the player created in the database.
